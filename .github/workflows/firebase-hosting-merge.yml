      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: NEW - Build your React application
      # This installs all your dependencies and runs the 'npm run build' command
      # which creates the 'dist' folder that Firebase needs to deploy.
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

      # Step 3: CORRECTED - Deploy to Firebase Hosting
